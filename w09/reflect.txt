Key Concepts and Learning Objectives
This workshop primarily explores several critical Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++:

Dynamic Memory Management
The implementation heavily emphasizes manual memory management, particularly through:


Custom memory allocation methods in the Utils class
Careful use of new and delete[] for dynamic memory
Implementing the Rule of Three (destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator)

The alocpy() methods in the Utils class showcase sophisticated memory handling:
cppCopychar* Utils::alocpy(char*& des, const char* src) const {
    delete[] des;  // Always free existing memory
    des = nullptr;
    if (src) {
        des = new char[strlen(src) + 1];
        strcpy(des, src);
    }
    return des;
}
This approach prevents memory leaks and ensures clean, safe memory operations.

Inheritance and Polymorphism
The Transcript class inherits from Marks, demonstrating:


Base class method overriding (the display() method)
Proper inheritance implementation
Extending base class functionality while maintaining core behaviors


Rule of Three/Five
The workshop reinforces the importance of implementing copy semantics correctly:


Copy constructor that performs deep copying
Copy assignment operator with self-assignment protection
Destructor to properly deallocate dynamic memory


Operator Overloading
Several operator overloads are implemented:


Copy assignment for Mark and Marks classes
Subscript operator [] for accessing marks
Stream insertion operator << for output

Design Considerations
The design reflects several best practices:

Separation of concerns (different classes for different responsibilities)
Encapsulation (private members, controlled access)
Flexible, reusable utility functions
Careful memory management

Potential Learning Challenges
Students might find challenging:

Understanding deep vs. shallow copying
Managing dynamic memory without standard library containers
Implementing complex assignment and copy semantics
Overriding inherited methods correctly

Broader Implications
This workshop teaches students:

Low-level memory management techniques
Importance of resource management
Creating flexible, extensible class hierarchies
Writing robust, self-contained classes

Code Quality Observations

Consistent naming conventions
Clear, descriptive method names
Comprehensive error prevention
Modular design supporting code reuse

Practical Applications
The transcript management system demonstrates real-world scenarios like:

Academic record keeping
Dynamic data collection and management
Flexible object composition and inheritance

Reflection on C++ Learning
This workshop reinforces that C++ requires:

Explicit memory management
Understanding of object lifecycles
Careful design of class interactions
Proactive error and resource management

The code exemplifies why C++ remains powerful for systems requiring precise control over resources and performance, while also supporting high-level object-oriented design principles.
By navigating these complexities, students develop a nuanced understanding of low-level memory management and object-oriented design principles that are crucial in professional software development.
