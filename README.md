# OOP244-Cpp-ObjectOriented-Assignments
# 📌 Course Description
**OOP244** is the next step after procedural programming in C.  
This course introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using **C++**, focusing on design principles, modular programming, and advanced coding practices.  
This repository contains my **workshops** and **milestones** completed as part of the course at **Seneca College**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this course, I gained experience in:
- Designing and implementing **C++ classes**
- Using **constructors, destructors, and operator overloading**
- Managing **dynamic memory** with the **Rule of Three**
- Applying **inheritance** and **polymorphism**
- Working with **abstract classes** and **virtual functions**
- Handling **file input/output** in C++
- Developing a complete **multi-phase project**

## ⚙️ Setup & Compilation
To compile a single program:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o program -Wall -std=c++11
./program
````

For projects with multiple files:

```bash
g++ *.cpp -o program -Wall -std=c++11
./program
```

## 🧪 Testing

* Milestones are tested using:

  * **Professor-provided testers** (e.g., `ms3_prof_tester.cpp`)
  * **Reference outputs** (`correct_output.txt`)
* Workshops are validated with **sample runs** and **edge cases**.

---

## 📖 Key Topics Covered

* C++ Classes & Encapsulation
* Constructors, Destructors & the **Rule of Three**
* Operator Overloading
* Dynamic Memory Management
* Inheritance & Polymorphism
* Abstract Classes & Virtual Functions
* File Input/Output
* Final Project: **Dine-In Digital**

## 🏆 Final Project: Dine-In Digital

The course culminates in a **multi-phase project** simulating a restaurant ordering system.
It integrates **all OOP concepts** into a real-world style application, with features including:

* Listing menu items
* Ordering food/drinks
* Generating and saving bills
* Resetting customer sessions
